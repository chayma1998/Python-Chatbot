# Python-Chatbot
Retrieval based chatbot using NLTK, Keras, Python, etc.

# Introduction
Today chatbots are everywhere, they are improving efficiency. Chatbot reduces the dependence on humans and can smartly answer the questions in real-time.

A chatbot is an intelligent piece of software that is capable of communicating and performing actions similar to a human. Chatbots are used a lot in customer interaction, marketing on social network sites, and instant messaging the client. There are two basic types of chatbot models based on how they are built; Retrieval based and Generative based models.

In this Python project with source code, we are going to build a chatbot using deep learning techniques. The chatbot will be trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses. We use a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the user’s message belongs to and then we will give a random response from the list of responses.
